# ClearDisk 2.0.0

Permanent removal now requires the exact lowercase word `delete` for both single and multiple selections. It still takes an explicit red-button click after entering the word. Move to Trash and Cancel remain available. Selection review, license checks and protected-path policy are unchanged. Native QA used a long-named disposable document, verified disabled/enabled states and cancelled without removing it.

Sparkle 2.10.0 now provides Check for Updates, signed release notes/feed verification, signed archive verification before extraction, installation and relaunch. Automatic checks are enabled; installation is user initiated. Termination is blocked during an active RemovalBatch operation or iCloud file operation. Existing receipts stay in Application Support and remain valid, including the owner-authorized unlimited developer key.

## Release procedure

1. Increase both CFBundleShortVersionString and the numeric CFBundleVersion in Scripts/Info.plist; never reuse an already published build number or archive URL.
2. Add release notes at releases/<version>.html and update the website version and metadata.
3. Run swift test, then Scripts/release-direct.sh. Requires Xcode, the Developer ID certificate, notarytool profile csvcompare and uv. The release script resolves SwiftPM's actual output, embeds/signs Sparkle, verifies both architecture UUIDs, notarizes/staples the app, renders the Finder installer, builds/signs/notarizes/staples the DMG, and stages the signed feed and versioned archive in website/public/updates. dmgbuild1.6.7 is pinned as a release-only tool; no runtime Python requirement.
4. Run website tests/typecheck/lint and production build, then deploy the existing Cloudflare Worker. Publish the versioned DMG and appcast together; retain older archives referenced by previous signed feeds. Verify live checksums and appcast, download and analytics protection.
5. Test the update from a separately signed older updater-enabled copy, confirm installation/relaunch and preserved licensing. Signatures, failure messages and no-update states must be verified before announcing completion.

Feed: https://cleardisk.app/updates/appcast.xml . The feed is revalidated on every fetch. Versioned updater downloads are separate from the new-download analytics endpoint, so updates do not inflate the primary download counter.

The private update signing key is in this Mac's login Keychain under Sparkle account `cleardisk-updates`. It is never committed or uploaded. Back it up securely using Sparkle's key export procedure before replacing this release machine. Public key: B6Sa/CaM6NuyemDRu2Nak3b8GzaEFRH23cim6wiu4Hk= . Do not replace that key when preparing another release.

Version1.1.1 and earlier have no updater: users must download2.0.0 manually once. Subsequent versions can update in-app. The initial signed test copy (display1.9.9/build9) discovered build10 from the production feed, displayed the release notes, downloaded, installed and relaunched as notarized2.0.0/build10 with the developer license preserved.

Sources checked September22: https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/ and https://dmgbuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html . The update integration follows the existing EasyDB AppUpdater and nested-code-signing pattern, with a separate ClearDisk update key.

## Final installer artifact

Build 11 includes the branded vertical drag-to-Applications Finder window. The background is rendered at 2× resolution and the Applications item is a real /Applications symlink. The release's DMG is 6,048,127 bytes, SHA256 `375d29ab6f6586aff751389acdfbd165bf88e2f15594e0aaec81b45029be1903`. Both app and DMG are notarized and stapled. The Sparkle archive signature and feed signature were verified after packaging. The existing Applications copy was updated to 2.0.0 (11).

Validation: 63 Swift tests and 49 website tests passed. Website typecheck, lint and production build passed. Native QA confirmed the long-filename dialog, developer license and complete signed update installation/relaunch. The test file remains intact. Versioned archives are not modified after publication; build10 remains available for an older feed, and build11 is the final installer release.

Production Worker: 7714de32-4b91-471d-b065-cf6a5fdef577. Live root DMG and versioned build11 archive both match the final checksum. Signed feed bytes match the locally verified feed and are served with revalidation. /download reports2.0.0 and explains the one-time manual upgrade. All72liveHTMLSEO checks passed; /analytics and /api/analytics reject anonymous access with401. Finder final visual check confirms both icons, the arrow, all labels and the installation instruction are visible without scrolling.
